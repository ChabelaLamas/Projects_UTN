<p>
   Welcome to my software development project repository! Here, you'll discover a compilation of projects I've undertaken, both independently and collaboratively, during my academic journey in Information Systems Engineering at Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires (UTN FRBA).
</p>
<p>The utilized programming languages are the following: C++, C, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, CSS, Java.</p>

## ðŸš€ Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/ChabelaLamas/Projects_UTN/tree/main/2023/Sistemas%20Operativos">Operating system with C on Linux<a>
The project entails a system comprising five interconnected modules connected through sockets, simulating the execution of processes within an actual operating system.

### <a href="https://github.com/ChabelaLamas/Projects_UTN/tree/main/2022/Paradigmas%20de%20Programacion">OOP, Functional and Logical paradigm<a>
Exploration of various programming paradigms through exercises and hands-on implementations, which provided me with a profound insight into how each paradigm tackles problem-solving and software design

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

Throughout these projects, I've acquired valuable experience in:

- Utilizing various technologies including C++, C, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, Java and CSS.
- Navigating complex problem-solving scenarios.
- Collaborating effectively within development teams.
- Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, encompassing polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, composition, and abstraction.
- Embracing both the functional and logical programming paradigms.
- Conducting comprehensive unit testing.
