<p>
   Welcome to my software development project repository! Here, you'll discover a compilation of projects I've undertaken, both independently and collaboratively, during my academic journey in Information Systems Engineering at Universidad TecnolÃ³gica Nacional, Facultad Regional Buenos Aires.
</p>
<p>The utilized programming languages are the following: C++, C, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, CSS.</p>

## ðŸš€ Projects

### <a href="https://github.com/damiangluk/proyectos_materias_utn/tree/main/2023/sistemas_operativos">Operating system with C on Linux<a>
The project entails a system comprising five interconnected modules connected through sockets, simulating the execution of processes within an actual operating system.

### <a href="https://github.com/damiangluk/proyectos_materias_utn/tree/main/2022/paradigmas_de_programacion">OOP, Functional and Logical paradigm<a>
Exploration of various programming paradigms through exercises and hands-on implementations, which provided me with a profound insight into how each paradigm tackles problem-solving and software design

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned

Throughout these projects, I've gained valuable insights in:

- Technologies such as C++, C, Haskell, Wollok, Prolog, HTML, CSS.
- Complex problem-solving.
- Collaboration in development teams.
- OOP including polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, composition and abstraction.
- Functional and logical paradigm.
- Unit tests
